In This course we were task with creating a program for ABCU to display courses that were provided at ABCU. We had to advise ABCU what was the best data structure to use such as linked lists, vector, hash table or binary tree. To approach this problem I took all I learned on data structures and Big O Notation to provide the best data structure to use. I had a few roadblocks over the time of the project. I struggled with the Syntax for C++ but to overcome this a used resources such as online tutoring and w3School.com. I now know the algorithms to search, insert and delete date from different data structures. This will help me in my furture coding career.
